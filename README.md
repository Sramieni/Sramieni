## 👤 About Me

I'm a graduate student in **Health Informatics** at Michigan Technological University, where I focus on combining data science, biomedical computing, and clinical insight to improve healthcare outcomes. My work spans across research, software development, and data analytics — and I’m particularly passionate about applying machine learning and mechanobiological models to real-world health challenges.

Currently, I'm part of a research initiative exploring wound healing and matrix mechanics using advanced imaging, traction force microscopy, and computational modeling.
